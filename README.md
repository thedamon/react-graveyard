# react-graveyard

Learning React it can be pretty confusing since so much has been changing to be sure that a recommended approach, or an entire concept is still being used. Searching the official docs can be a pretty good way of sussing this out, but they aren't always complete and don't always provide alternatives (and I also presonally find them generally hard to read/understand)

A list of deprecated/out of style techniques/functions/concepts in React with alternate approaches and code samples.

##Submitting

Please submit pull requests with additions, ideas and corrections. I don't know enough about React to do this well. Also feel free to suggest changes to the format. The format should follow:

###Name
Brief description of thing

```
//snippet of code example
```

Why it isn't commonly used anymore.

Brief description of alternate Approach(es) to acheive similar effect

```
//code snippet of alternate
```

Any further discussion. ie: when it might still make sense to use.
